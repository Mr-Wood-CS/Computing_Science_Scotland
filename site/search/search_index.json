Its primary goal is to implement solutions quickly, minimizing upfront planning. RAD involves producing incremental versions or prototypes to refine requirements and address issues as they arise.</p> <p>While RAD can significantly reduce development time, it may lead to an overemphasis on the Graphical User Interface (GUI) rather than the core functionality of the software. Continuous iteration can also result in a disorganized process, increased errors, and long-term maintenance challenges. Therefore, RAD is best suited for smaller, dynamic projects like apps or websites, but is less ideal for large-scale or mission-critical systems.</p>"},{"location":"Levels/Senior_Phase/Unit_1_SDD/2.0_Analysis/L5/5.0_Home/","title":"Analysis","text":"<p>Quick Links</p> <ul> <li>Inputs</li> <li>Proccesses</li> <li>Outputs</li> <li>Functional Requirements - Example 1</li> <li>Functional Requirements - Example 2</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Levels/Senior_Phase/Unit_1_SDD/2.0_Analysis/L5/5.0_Home/#functional-requirements-inputs-processes-and-outputs","title":"Functional Requirements (Inputs, Processes and Outputs)","text":""},{"location":"Levels/Senior_Phase/Unit_1_SDD/2.0_Analysis/L5/5.0_Home/#inputs","title":"Inputs","text":"<p><code>Inputs</code> are what goes \u2018in\u2019 to the program - a common example would be anything the user is asked to type in.</p>"},{"location":"Levels/Senior_Phase/Unit_1_SDD/2.0_Analysis/L5/5.0_Home/#processes","title":"Processes","text":"<p><code>Processes</code> are the \u2018thinking\u2019 done by the program.
