RAD involves producing incremental versions or prototypes to refine requirements and address issues as they arise.</p> <p>While RAD can significantly reduce development time, it may lead to an overemphasis on the Graphical User Interface (GUI) rather than the core functionality of the software. Continuous iteration can also result in a disorganized process, increased errors, and long-term maintenance challenges.
