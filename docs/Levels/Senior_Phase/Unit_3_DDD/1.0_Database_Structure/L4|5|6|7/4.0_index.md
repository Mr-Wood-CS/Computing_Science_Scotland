# Relational Databases

A relational database consists of two or more tables that are linked through relationships between the data they store.

!!! note
    In database design, each `Table` in a relational database represents an **Entity** — a real-world object like a Customer or Product.
    
    Each `Field` (or column) in the table represents an __Attribute__ — a property of that entity, such as Name or Price.

    This difference is important when designing the structure of your database, even though software like Access may still use the terms *table* and *field*.

## Fields

A 'Field' holds one piece of data at a time – for example, a person's name, age, or phone number.

## Records

A 'Record' holds all the data for one entry in the table – for example, all the information about a single customer.
