# 2.3 - Legal Feasability

This has to do with any conflicts that might arise between the proposed system and legal requirements. 
    
!!! abstract "For example"

    * How would the new system affect contracts and liability?
    * Are health and safety issues in place?
    * Would the system be legal under laws such as GDPR?
    * Would the system be legal under other laws local to the UK or wider jurisdictions where your software may be used or used to store data from inhabitants of those countries e.g. EU or USA?
    * What are the software licensing implications for the new system?
    
Software licensing can also be quite a thorny problem. 

Licences can be purchased as:
    
* client licence (per seat), 
* server licence, 
* network licence or site licence and the period of operation may be annual or perpetual
    
In addition, site licence and the period of operation (annual or perpetual) must also be considered. 

Software vendors vary in their licensing regulations so this has to be fully investigated.
