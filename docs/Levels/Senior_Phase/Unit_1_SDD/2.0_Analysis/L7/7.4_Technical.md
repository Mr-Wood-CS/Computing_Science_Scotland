# 2.4 - Technical Feasability

The technical feasibility study must identify the technologies that will be necessary for the proposed system to function correctly. 

Once identified, the technical feasibility then considers whether or not the technologies necessary are currently available.

* If the required technologies are available, the technical feasibility must determine whether or not the client already has the necessary resources. If not, the resources that must be acquired are identified and suitable hardware and software recommended.
