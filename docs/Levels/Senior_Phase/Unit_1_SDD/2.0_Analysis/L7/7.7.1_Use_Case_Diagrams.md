## What is UML?

Unified Modelling Language is a notation of symbols and diagrams to communicate object-oriented analysis and design. 

It also documents the construction of a software system, including the business model, where the dynamic behaviour is represented.

## Types of UML

There are many different applications of UML diagrams but we will only be looking at two, they are:

* Use case diagram shows the functionality of the system from the usersâ€™ perspective and is essentially non-technical. 

* Class diagrams show a class represented by a rectangle labelled by its name, attributes and operations. Classes may be associated similar to entity relationships.  (`These will be covered in the Object Oriented Programming Pages`)

## Use Case Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** are a means for specifying required usages of a system. Typically, they are used to capture the requirements of a system

This diagram is useful for representing the system from a `usersâ€™ perspective`, they:

* Are used to gather the requirements of the system

* Are used to get an outside view of the system

* Identify the internal and external actors in a system

* Show the interaction among the requirements of the system

* Aid communication between the client and the developer

## Components of a Use Case Diagram

We will focus on 4 main components to a Use Case Diagram

1. A System (System Boundary)
2. Actors
3. Use Cases
4. Relationships

## UML - System/System Boundary

The system is used to define the scope of the use case and drawn as a rectangle. 

**This an optional element but useful when visualising large systems.**

The system boundary represents the limits of the system being developed: only those actors and processes to be considered are illustrated within the system boundary.

## UML - Actors

An actor interacts with the system being developed. 

The actor may be a human or an entity that interacts with the system, for example another system or server, and is external to the system being developed.

An actor can be:

* Primary
* Secondary

<figcaption>Actor Example</figcaption>
</figure>

### Primary and Secondary Actors

A **primary actor** uses the system to achieve a goal. The Use Case documents the interactions between the system and the actors to achieve the goal of the primary actor.`For example a customer buying an item`.

A **secondary actor** is one that the system needs assistance from to achieve the primary actorâ€™s goal. For example a cashier in a bank

### Examples of different types of actors
A UML case diagram shows an actor by using the symbol:

<figure markdown="span">
![Use Case Actors](Images/UseCase2.png){ width="700" }
<figcaption>The above are examples of actors, depending on the problem being solved.</figcaption>
</figure>

## UML - Use Cases

A use case describes an action (process) or a sequence of actions (processes) that must be in the system being developed. They are represented using ellipses. 

These help to determine the requirements of the system under consideration, by describing the functionality that the system will provide. 

A process may be initiated by an actor or may be started by the system itself, providing a useful result to an actor.

</figure>

## UML - Relationships

A use case diagram can have five types of relationship:

1. Association between an actor and a use case
2. Generalisation of an actor
3. Extension between two use cases
4. Include between two use cases
5. Generalisation of a use case
6. Each actor must be associated with at least one use case (although can be connected with multiple use cases)

Likewise a use case must be associated with at least one use case 

> An `association` is represented by a line with `no arrowheads` between the actor and use case.

![](Images/UseCase4.png){ width="400" }

</figure>

### Generalisation

Generalisation of an actor means one actor can inherit the role of another actor. The descendant actor inherits all the use cases of the ancestor.

* This means they would not need to be duplicated

* A line, with a single solid arrowhead pointing at the ancestor actor, connects a `descendant actor` to the `ancestor actor`.

### Extending between Two Use Cases

Extending a basic use case provides additional functionality to the system.

<figure markdown="span">
![](Images/UseCase6.png){ width="600" }
<figcaption>Example of Extending</figcaption>
</figure>

An **extended use case** is connected to a basic use case using a dashed line, with a single solid arrowhead pointing at the basic use case. The label `<<extend>>` is placed on the line.

ðŸ”‘ **Extend indicates a conditional use case.**

So in the diagram above the Credit Card Payment use case **may** lead to the Calculate Interest use case.

### Include between two use cases

An **included use case** is part of the basic use case. It is a **mandatory** process, as the basic use case is incomplete without it.

<figure markdown="span">
![](Images/UseCase7.png){ width="600" }
<figcaption>Example of Include</figcaption>
</figure>

An **included use case** is connected to the basic use case using a **dashed line** with a single solid arrowhead, pointing at the common basic use case. The label `<<include>>` is placed on the line.

### Generalisation of a use case

This is similar to **generalisation of an actor.**

<figure markdown="span">
![](Images/UseCase8.png){ width="600" }
<figcaption>Example of Generalisation of a Use Case</figcaption>
</figure>

A line, with a single solid arrowhead pointing at the **ancestor use case**, connects a **descendant use case** to the ancestor use case.

    === "Scenario"

        The owners of a monthly magazine decide to update the company website. 

        The current website allows users to access online versions of articles printed in the monthly magazines. 

        Requirements for the updated website are listed below.

        `The updated website will allow all users to: `

        * access a maximum of five free articles every month 
        * search for articles over 12 months old 
        * subscribe to the full service using a secure payment system

        `The updated website will allow subscribed users to: `

        * login to gain access to the full service 
        * access any number of articles 
        * search for articles without restriction 
        * renew their subscription at a reduced rate using a secure payment system
