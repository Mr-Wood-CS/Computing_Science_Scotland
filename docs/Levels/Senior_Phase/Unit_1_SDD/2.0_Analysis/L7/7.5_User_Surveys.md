# ðŸ“‹ User Surveys

In addition to to the Feasability study, surveys and questionnaires help gather feedback from users, especially when many opinions are needed. This helps ensure the system meets real needs.

The users of a particular program are the best people to identify the existing problems with the software and how it could be improved.

If the software being developed is new, the target user group should understand the programme. 

> For example, a new library system would be developed following some time spent capturing the experience of existing librarians and how they operate.

When the opinion of a number of users is required, it is often easier to create a survey or questionnaire which will capture the information that the project team require.

**Example**:  
A college developing a new library system might survey librarians to ask what features they need most.

user feasibility is a key factor in that determination. It ensures that the proposed solution aligns with user expectations and requirements, which is essential for the project's success. 
Here's why user feasibility is important within a broader feasibility study: 
Identifies potential roadblocks:
It helps uncover any usability issues, lack of user acceptance, or barriers to adoption early on, allowing for adjustments to the design or implementation plan.
Ensures user needs are met:
A user feasibility study ensures that the project will actually address the needs of the target audience, making it more likely to be successful in the long run.
Improves user experience:
By understanding user preferences and behaviors, the project can be designed to be more user-friendly and intuitive.
Increases adoption rate:
If users find the product or service easy to use and beneficial, they are more likely to adopt it, leading to a higher success rate for the overall project.
Essentially, user feasibility is not just a nice-to-have; it's a vital component of a comprehensive feasibility study that helps determine whether a project is worth pursuing and how to maximize its chances of success.
