# 👾 03 - Creating the Enemy

=== "🕹️ Introduction"

    In this lesson, you’ll give your player sprite the ability to fire lasers or bullets when a button is pressed — just like in a real space shooter!

    You’ll learn how to:

	* Use the __Space Bar__ to fire a projectile.
	* Make the projectile move upwards on the screen.
	* Keep the game fun by allowing the player to shoot again and again.

    By the end of the lesson, your spaceship will be ready to fight back against enemies in future lessons!
